iTunesManager - small Windows utility that extends functionality of Apple iTunes.
With iTunesManager you can play/pause and switch tracks with hot keys and quickly jump to the composition you need.

Default settings are following:
 - Win+PgUp - prev track;
 - Win+PgDn - next track;
 - Win+Ins - play/pause;
 - Win+Home - open quick jump ("Song Selection") window
(for now it can be changed only through .config file, settings window is pending).

In "Song Selection" window you can select one of the existing playlists or just enter artist name (or even its part) - new playlist will be created automatically.
After that all you need to do is to select song from the playlist and press "Play" (or "Shuffle") button to play (or shuffle) the selected track.

You can say - this kind of functionality already exists in iTunes. Yes, but now you do not have to use mouse (or pressing Tab repeatedly). If you don't like it - you still can use it for hotkeys or choose any other iTunes hot key application - there are a lot of them available at the Internet.
